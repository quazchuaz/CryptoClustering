# CryptoClustering
Use unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The specific method applied was k-means clustering with elbow charts used to find the optimal value for k. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was also used to narrow down the number of features so that only variables with high relative explanatory power were retained.
